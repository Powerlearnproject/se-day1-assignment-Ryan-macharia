#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Importance of Software engineering in the technology industry include; Creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare. Software engineering is also important in the continuous development and innovation

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 a) The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
 b) The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
 c) The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a)Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
b)Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
c)Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
d)Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
f)Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
g)Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies involves the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile methodologies involves the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. 
Waterfall methodology is best suited for projects with clear, unchanging requirements, a need for extensive documentation, or regulatory constraints. Example: Developing software for medical devices where compliance is critical whereas agile methodology is best suited for projects where requirements are expected to evolve, where speed and flexibility are paramount, or where ongoing user feedback is essential. Example: Developing a consumer-facing web application in a rapidly changing market.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
b) Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
c) Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a) Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples of IDEs include Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
b) Version Control Systems (VCS) provide software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples of VCS include Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Challenges include; Changing Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  a)Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software. Helps in early bug detection by testing units individually, developers can identify and fix bugs at an early stage, reducing the cost and complexity of later fixes.
  b)Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. Helps detecting interface issue: Ensures that components developed independently can work together without issues.
  c)System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. Helps in verification of Complete System: Ensures that the entire application works as intended across all integrated components.
  d)Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.Helps in user satisfaction: Ensures that the software meets the needs and expectations of the end users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining the input prompts given to AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) like GPT, to achieve desired outputs. Importance of prompt engineering include determine what your goals are for using AI tools, Perform tasks, Consider using machine learning methods.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about the environment."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the impact of deforestation on biodiversity in tropical rainforests."

Explanation:
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear (focusing on deforestation), specific (targeting its impact on biodiversity), and concise (limiting the scope to tropical rainforests). This guides the AI to provide a targeted and relevant response, reducing ambiguity and ensuring the output is aligned with the user's intent.
